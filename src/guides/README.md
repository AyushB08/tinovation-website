# Contributing to Guides

- make a pull request when it is finished?
- written in .svx (svelte markdown but cooler? like mdx but... idk)
  - can embed svelte components into markdown
    - making special components for maybe jupyter notebooks? code blocks?
    - image paths lead to the static folder and must start with a "/"
- "frontmatter" (basically metadata) is yaml, starts and ends with "---"
- the filename for the .svx file determines the route on the /heap/[id]
- prettier doesn't work for svx yet :(, so better keep your markdown neat
- must indent with tabs to get indentation to work for ol/ul
