## Dev Notes

- before committing, run prettier to maintain consistency!
- mdsvex is a smaller project that isn't as supported as mdx's official support for react/vue, but I hope that changes!
  - see here for mdsvex versioning problems: https://github.com/pngwn/MDsveX/issues/518
  - I hope this works... wth it's crazy! it actually works!
