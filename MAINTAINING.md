# Editing Content! (Maintaining)

You will only really have to edit or add to some JS objects inside a `.ts` file, and I used TypeScript so most of the data has an expected shape to it.

## General Club Info

All of it is in `src/lib/info.ts` and the variable names are pretty self-explanatory. Probably only have to update this once every year.

Path(s): `src/lib/info.ts`

## Leaderboards

Refer to [this guide](https://github.com/tinovationchs/tinovation-website/blob/main/src/lib/leaderboards/README.md). I always forgot to change the last updated date :3

Path(s): `src/lib/leaderboards/*.ts`, `src/lib/leaderboard.ts`

## Showcase

Refer to [this guide](https://github.com/tinovationchs/tinovation-website/blob/main/src/lib/showcase.md).

Path(s): `static/showcase/`, `src/lib/showcase.ts`

## Guides

Refer to [this guide](https://github.com/tinovationchs/tinovation-website/blob/main/src/guides/README.md). If you're lost, just copy what's already existing and figure it out from there. üòê
